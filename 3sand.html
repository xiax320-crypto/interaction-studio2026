  <h1>The Book of Sand</h1>

    Thy rope of sands...

116. The  line  is  made  up  of  an  infinite  number  of 
points;  the  plane  of  an  infinite  number  of  lines; 
the  volume  of  an  infinite  number  of  planes;  the 
hypervolume  of  an  infinite  number  of  volumes. 
.  .  .  No,  unquestionably  this  is  not — more  geome- 
trico — the  best  way  of  beginning  my  story.  To 
claim  that  it  is  true  is  nowadays  the  convention  of 
every  made-up  story.  Mine,  however,  is  true. 

I  live  alone  in  a  fourth-floor  apartment  on  Bel- 
grano  Street,  in  Buenos  Aires.  Late  one  evening,  a 
few  months  back,  I  heard  a  knock  at  my  door.  I 
opened  it  and  a  stranger  stood  there.  He  was  a  tall 
man,  with  nondescript  features — or  perhaps  it  was 
my  myopia  that  made  them  seem  that  way. 
Dressed  in  gray  and  carrying  a  gray  suitcase  in  his 
hand,  he  had  an  unassuming  look  about  him.  I 
saw  at  once  that  he  was  a  foreigner.  At  first,  he 
struck  me  as  old;  only  later  did  I  realize  that  I  had 
been  misled  by  his  thin  blond  hair,  which  was,  in  a 
Scandinavian  sort  of  way,  almost  white.  During  the 
course  of  our  conversation,  which  was  not  to  last 
an  hour,  I  found  out  that  he  came  from  the  Ork- 
neys.

117. I  invited  him  in,  pointing  to  a  chair.  He  paused 
awhile  before  speaking.  A  kind  of  gloom  ema- 
nated from  him — as  it  does  now  from  me. 

"I  sell  Bibles,"  he  said. 

Somewhat  pedantically,  I  replied,  "In  this  house 
are  several  English  Bibles,  including  the  first — 
John  Wiclif's.  I  also  have  Cipriano  de  Valera's, 
Luther's — which,  from  a  literary  viewpoint,  is  the 
worst — and  a  Latin  copy  of  the  Vulgate.  As  you 
see,  it's  not  exactly  Bibles  I  stand  in  need  of." 

After  a  few  moments  of  silence,  he  said,  "I  don't 
only  sell  Bibles.  I  can  show  you  a  holy  book  I  came 
across  on  the  outskirts  of  Bikaner.  It  may  interest 
you." 

He  opened  the  suitcase  and  laid  the  book  on  a 
table.  It  was  an  octavo  volume,  bound  in  cloth. 
There  was  no  doubt  that  it  had  passed  through 
many  hands.  Examining  it,  I  was  surprised  by  its 
unusual  weight.  On  the  spine  were  the  words 
"Holy  Writ"  and,  below  them,  "Bombay." 

"Nineteenth  century,  probably,"  I  remarked. 

"I  don't  know,"  he  said.  "I've  never  found  out." 

I  opened  the  book  at  random.  The  script  was 
strange  to  me.  The  pages,  which  were  worn  and 
typographically  poor,  were  laid  out  in  double  col- 
umns, as  in  a  Bible.  The  text  was  closely  printed, 
and  it  was  ordered  in  versicles.  In  the  upper 
corners  of  the  pages  were  Arabic  numbers.  I  no- 
ticed that  one  left-hand  page  bore  the  number  (let 
us  say)  40,514  and  the  facing  right-hand  page  999. 
I  turned  the  leaf;  it  was  numbered  with  eight 
digits.  It  also  bore  a  small  illustration,  like  the  kind 
used  in  dictionaries — an  anchor  drawn  with  pen 
and  ink,  as  if  by  a  schoolboy's  clumsy  hand. 

It  was  at  this  point  that  the  stranger  said,  "Look 
</h4>
<p>
118. at  the  illustration  closely.  You'll  never  see  it  again." 

I  noted  my  place  and  closed  the  book.  At  once,  I 
reopened  it.  Page  by  page,  in  vain,  I  looked  for 
the  illustration  of  the  anchor.  "It  seems  to  be  a 
version  of  Scriptures  in  some  Indian  language,  is  it 
not?"  I  said  to  hide  my  dismay. 

"No,"  he  replied.  Then,  as  if  confiding  a  secret, 
he  lowered  his  voice.  "I  acquired  the  book  in  a 
town  out  on  the  plain  in  exchange  for  a  handful  of 
rupees  and  a  Bible.  Its  owner  did  not  know  how  to 
read.  I  srspect  that  he  saw  the  Book  of  Books  as  a 
talisman.  He  was  of  the  lowest  caste;  nobody  but 
other  untouchables  could  tread  his  shadow  with- 
out contamination.  He  told  me  his  book  was  called 
the  Book  of  Sand,  because  neither  the  book  nor 
the  sand  has  any  beginning  or  end." 

The  stranger  asked  me  to  find  the  first  page. 

I  laid  my  left  hand  on  the  cover  and,  trying  to 
put  my  thumb  on  the  flyleaf,  I  opened  the  book.  It 
was  useless.  Every  time  I  tried,  a  number  of  pages 
came  between  the  cover  and  my  thumb.  It  was  as 
if  they  kept  growing  from  the  book. 

"Now  find  the  last  page." 

Again  I  failed.  In  a  voice  that  was  not  mine,  I 
barely  managed  to  stammer,  "This  can't  be." 

Still  speaking  in  a  low  voice,  the  stranger  said, 
"It  can't  be,  but  it  is.  The  number  of  pages  in  this 
book  is  no  more  or  less  than  infinite.  None  is  the 
first  page,  none  the  last.  I  don't  know  why  they're 
numbered  in  this  arbitrary  way.  Perhaps  to 
suggest  that  the  terms  of  an  infinite  series  admit 
any  number." 

Then,  as  if  he  were  thinking  aloud,  he  said,  "If 
space  is  infinite,  we  may  be  at  any  point  in  space. 
If  time  is  infinite,  we  may  be  at  any  point  in  time."
